# classification
We are exploring ABC-random forests and neural networks to do classification.
Our applications are inspired from haemodynamics.

- Model Input: Local blood flow detected.
- Model Output: Disease symptoms associated with blood pressure in disease area, etc.
- Base Models: Navier-Stokes Equation via Finite Element, ABC-random forests, Neural Networks.
